-----!BROKEN!-----
- cannot detect AMD GPU and when switching to software (cpu) it fails.

TODO (in no particular order):



 - add variable frame frate

 - Support for multiple audio/video tracks - there is an nvidia shadowplay setting to seperate mic and desktop audio, this needs to be accounted for and they need to be squished into one

 - more robust video length scaling , maybe also check file size

 ----------DONE----------
- add AMD/Intel gpu support, switching to software encoding of not available
