STILL NEED TO ADD (in no particular order):

 - add variable frame frate

 - Support for multiple audio/video tracks - there is an nvidia shadowplay setting to seperate mic and desktop audio, this needs to be accounted for and they need to be squished into one

 - more robust video length scaling , maybe also check file size

 - make work for non-nvidia gpus and if no gpu present, switch to software encoding
